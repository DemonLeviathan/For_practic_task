You can't break me
Twelve years I've fought for this
Twelve years, blood sweat and tears
For my family here beside me
True to the ethos held inside me
Life pushes hard, you push back
Time makes its mark, you gotta stand the test
Every dog has its day
We make it count
We find our own way
You can't shut this down
I still spit fire
This truth rings loud
You better listen up
You can't
You can't break me
You can't
You can't break me
Twelve years I've fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Still strong motherfucker so step back
You should know by now
Here comes whats next Through blood, sweat, tears
We're still here
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Here comes bring this shit down
