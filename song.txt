Twelve years I've fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Still strong, you can't break me
Twelve years I've fought for this
Twelve years, my heart still beats
For the ones who've stood beside me
Through the values that define me
No compromise, no surrender
These beliefs, they make me whole
Never the breaker, promise keeper
Remains the ethic instilled in me
Never one to bite my tongue
Never turn, never run
I've seen with my own eyes
The price of life and the cost of lies
You can't shut this down
I still spit fire
This truth rings loud
You better listen up
You can't
You can't break me
You can't
You can't break me
